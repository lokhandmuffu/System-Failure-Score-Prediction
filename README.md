# System-Failure-Score-Prediction
This project aims to predict a systemâ€™s failure score for each week of the following year. The dataset comprises weekly sensor values spread over 4 years. Analyzing the dataset, the prediction was deduced to be a regression problem. Regression Algorithms such as Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, Random Forest Regressor, and SVM Regressor were used. All the models were compared using significance tests and evaluated using the mean absolute error. The evaluations pointed toward Random Forest Regressor to be a promising candidate for the problem.
